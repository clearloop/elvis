As we know, `Elvis` is a famous rock star, both a famous rock song named `Calling Elvis` wrote by `Dire Straits` which inspired a unknown rock star writing down these chords.

For now, Elvis, the rock star will rise once again, **beyond** the internet —— truely your wasm web library, 🦀 + 🕸  => 💖

[The Evlis Book][1] mainly talks about the usage of [calling-elvis][2], if you want to use `low-level` api rusting the web, plz check out [elvis' rust doc][3].

## Goals 🎯

Writing web pages in **pure rust or javascript** using wasm bindings, **without** `jsx` or `any other` complex syntax, of course, **not** writing `html` nor `css` either.
