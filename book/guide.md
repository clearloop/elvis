# Calling Elvis 🦀 🕸  🎸 📡 🚀 🪐 🛰

Is anybody home?

As we know, `Elvis` is a famous rock star, and both a famous rock song named `Calling Elvis` wrote by `Dire Straits` which inspired a unknown rock star to write down these chords(code || words).

For now, Elvis, the rock star, will rise, once again, **beyond** the internet —— truely your wasm web library, 🦀 + 🕸  => 💖

[The Evlis Book][1] mainly talks about the usage of the npm package `calling-elvis`, and if you want to use `"low-level"` api rusting the web, plz check out [elvis' rust doc][2].

## Goals 🎯

Writing web pages in **pure javascript** using wasm bindings, **without** `jsx` or `any other` complex syntax, **just javascript**, of course, **not** writing `html` nor `css` either.
